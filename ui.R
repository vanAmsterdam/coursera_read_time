                       To do this as quickly and lean as possible, I built a
                        shiny app for that (this is not the app). 
                        I was curious how long it was going to take me to screen 
                        all the abstracts, so I 
                        recorded the screening time per abstract as I went along. It was
                         probable that the screening time would go down after 
                        having screened more abstracts. To visualize this 
                        relationship, I've plotted the screening time vs the 
                        index of the abstract, and fitted a polynomial."), br(),

                        degree for this fit is")),
